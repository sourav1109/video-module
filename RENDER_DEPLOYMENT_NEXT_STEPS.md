- Click: **"Save"**

### Step 5: Backend Auto-Redeploys

## ⚠️ Important Security Notes

## 🔧 If Something Fails

### Backend shows 🔴 Red
1. Go to: **Logs** tab
2. Look for error messages (red text)
3. Common issues:
   - DATABASE_URL not set → Add it in Environment
   - Node modules not installed → Check buildCommand
   - Port conflict → Should be port 5000

### Frontend shows 🔴 Red
1. Go to: **Logs** tab
2. Common issues:
   - Build failed → Check npm dependencies
   - Missing environment variables → Check REACT_APP_API_URL

### Can't login or create room
1. Check backend health: `https://video-call-backend-XXXX.onrender.com/health`
