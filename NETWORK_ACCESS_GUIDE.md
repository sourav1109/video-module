# Network Access Guide - Connect from Multiple Devices

## ‚úÖ What We Fixed

1. **Backend listening on all network interfaces** - Changed from `localhost` to `0.0.0.0`
2. **CORS policy updated** - Allows connections from any origin
3. **Socket.IO CORS updated** - Allows WebSocket connections from any device

## üåê How to Access from Other Devices

### Step 1: Find Your Computer's IP Address

**On Windows (your main computer):**
1. Open PowerShell or Command Prompt
2. Run: `ipconfig`
3. Look for "IPv4 Address" under your active network adapter
4. Example: `192.168.1.100` or `192.168.0.50`

**Quick command:**
```powershell
ipconfig | findstr IPv4
```

### Step 2: Restart Backend Server

The backend needs to restart to apply the network configuration changes.

**Stop current backend** (if running):
```powershell
# Press Ctrl+C in the backend terminal
```

**Start backend:**
```powershell
cd C:\Users\hp\Desktop\vcfinal\video-call-module-\backend
npm start
```

**Look for this output:**
```
üöÄ Video Call Server running on port 5000
   Protocol: HTTP
   Local: http://localhost:5000
   Network: http://192.168.X.X:5000
   üì± Access from other devices using: http://192.168.X.X:5000
```

The IP shown in "Network" is what you'll use from other devices!

### Step 3: Configure Frontend for Network Access

**Option A: Use Environment Variable (Recommended)**

Create `.env` file in `frontend` folder:
```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://192.168.X.X:5000
REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL=http://192.168.X.X:5000
```

Replace `192.168.X.X` with your actual IP address!

**Option B: Serve Frontend on Network**

Start frontend to listen on all interfaces:
```powershell
cd C:\Users\hp\Desktop\vcfinal\video-call-module-\frontend
$env:HOST="0.0.0.0"; npm start
```

Then access from other devices: `http://192.168.X.X:3000`

### Step 4: Connect from Other Device

**On your phone/tablet/another computer:**

1. Make sure the device is on the **same Wi-Fi network**
2. Open browser
3. Go to: `http://192.168.X.X:3000` (use your computer's IP)
4. Login with your credentials
5. Join the same class!

## üîí Firewall Configuration

If you can't connect, you may need to allow the ports through Windows Firewall:

### Allow Backend Port 5000

```powershell
# Run as Administrator
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Video Call Backend" -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 5000 -Action Allow
```

### Allow Frontend Port 3000

```powershell
# Run as Administrator
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Video Call Frontend" -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 3000 -Action Allow
```

**Or use Windows Firewall GUI:**
1. Open "Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security"
2. Click "Inbound Rules" ‚Üí "New Rule"
3. Select "Port" ‚Üí Next
4. TCP ‚Üí Specific local ports: `5000` ‚Üí Next
5. Allow the connection ‚Üí Next
6. Check all profiles ‚Üí Next
7. Name: "Video Call Backend" ‚Üí Finish
8. Repeat for port `3000`

## üì± Mobile Device Access

### Android/iOS Browser

1. Connect phone to same Wi-Fi
2. Open Chrome/Safari
3. Enter: `http://192.168.X.X:3000`
4. Login and join class

### Common Issues on Mobile

**Camera/Mic not working:**
- Make sure you're using `http://` (not `https://`)
- Some browsers require HTTPS for camera access
- Try Chrome browser if default doesn't work

**"Not secure" warning:**
- This is normal for local IP addresses
- Click "Advanced" ‚Üí "Proceed anyway"

## üß™ Testing the Connection

### Test Backend API from Other Device

Open browser on other device and visit:
```
http://192.168.X.X:5000/api/video-call/health
```

You should see a success response!

### Test with curl (from other device)

```bash
curl http://192.168.X.X:5000/api/video-call/health
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Failed to fetch" or "Network error"

**Solutions:**
1. ‚úÖ Make sure both devices are on same Wi-Fi network
2. ‚úÖ Check Windows Firewall allows port 5000 and 3000
3. ‚úÖ Backend is running and shows network IP
4. ‚úÖ Use correct IP address (not localhost)
5. ‚úÖ Antivirus isn't blocking connections

### Issue: Can access frontend but can't login

**Solutions:**
1. Frontend might still be using `localhost:5000` for API
2. Create `.env` file with correct backend IP
3. Restart frontend after creating `.env`

### Issue: Can login but video call doesn't connect

**Solutions:**
1. Socket.IO might be trying to connect to localhost
2. Check browser console for Socket.IO errors
3. Make sure `.env` has both `REACT_APP_API_URL` and `REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL`

### Issue: One-way video (teacher sees student but not vice versa)

**Solutions:**
1. Mediasoup might need network configuration
2. Both devices need to access backend via same IP
3. Check NAT/Router settings if on different subnets

## üåç Production Deployment (Future)

For production use:

1. **Use proper domain name** instead of IP address
2. **Enable HTTPS** with SSL certificate
3. **Restrict CORS** to specific domains
4. **Use environment variables** for all URLs
5. **Deploy to cloud** (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)

## üìã Quick Reference

### Your Setup (Example - Replace with actual values)

```
Main Computer IP: 192.168.1.100
Backend URL: http://192.168.1.100:5000
Frontend URL: http://192.168.1.100:3000

From Main Computer:
  - Use: http://localhost:3000

From Other Devices:
  - Use: http://192.168.1.100:3000
```

### Environment Variables (.env in frontend folder)

```env
# Replace with your computer's IP address
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://192.168.1.100:5000
REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL=http://192.168.1.100:5000
```

- [ ] .env file created with correct IP (if using)
- [ ] Both devices on same Wi-Fi network
- [ ] Can access `http://YOUR_IP:5000/api/video-call/health` from other device
