# ⚠️ CRITICAL: You MUST Delete Old Services First

Render is stuck trying to build Docker because the services were created as Docker services. **No amount of code changes will fix this** until you delete them.

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:

### Step 1: Go to Render Dashboard
https://dashboard.render.com

### Step 2: Delete BOTH Services

**For video-call-backend:**
1. Click on the service name
2. Click the **Settings** tab (on the left)
3. Scroll ALL the way down
4. Click the **red "Delete Service"** button
5. Type the service name to confirm
6. Click "Delete"

**For video-call-frontend:**
1. Repeat the same steps above

### Step 3: Verify Both Are Deleted
- Go back to dashboard
- You should see no services listed (or empty)
- Only then proceed to Step 4

## Step 4: Create Fresh Services from Blueprint

Once services are deleted:

1. Click: **"New +"** button
2. Click: **"Blueprint"**
3. Click: **"Connect GitHub"** (or it shows your account)
4. Select repository: **`sourav1109/video-module`**
5. Leave branch as: **`main`**
6. Leave name as default
7. Click: **"Apply"** button

Render will:
- Clone your repository
- Read `render.yaml`
- Create backend (Node.js)
- Create frontend (Static)
- Build both services automatically

---

## What to Expect

### During Build (5-10 minutes):
- Logs appear showing npm install
- Shows build progress
- Then shows deploy progress

### After Build:
- Backend service: 🟢 **Green** (Running)
- Frontend service: 🟢 **Green** (Running)
- You'll see URLs like:
  - `https://video-call-backend-XXXX.onrender.com`
  - `https://video-call-frontend-XXXX.onrender.com`

---

## Why This Fixes It

**Before (Broken):**
- Render tried to build Docker (looking for Dockerfile)
- No Dockerfile at root → Fail

**After (Fixed):**
- Render reads render.yaml
- Deploys as blueprint services
- Uses native Node.js runtime
- No Docker needed

---

## The render.yaml is Ready

Your `render.yaml` has:
✅ Backend service (Node.js, cd backend && npm start)
✅ Frontend service (Static, npm run build)
✅ Correct environment variables
✅ Proper configuration

**You just need to delete old services and deploy fresh.**

---

## Timeline

1. Delete services: **2 minutes**
2. Create from blueprint: **1 minute**
3. Build and deploy: **5-10 minutes**
4. **Total: 15 minutes to live deployment!**

---

## When You're Done

1. ✅ Backend 🟢 Green
2. ✅ Frontend 🟢 Green
3. ✅ Add DATABASE_URL to backend Environment
4. ✅ Share frontend URL with your friend
5. ✅ Friend joins from another state
6. ✅ Video call works! 🎉

---

**GO DELETE THE SERVICES NOW** (I can't do this for you, only you can delete from Render Dashboard)

Then reply "DELETED" and we'll verify the fresh deployment! 🚀
