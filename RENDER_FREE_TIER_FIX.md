# 🚨 RENDER FREE TIER WEBRTC FIX

## Problem
```
❌ SEND TRANSPORT FAILED - Streaming will not work
📡 [SendTransport] connectionstatechange -> failed
```

**Root Cause:** MediaSoup requires UDP ports (10000-11000) which Render's FREE TIER BLOCKS.

---

## ✅ **SOLUTION: 3 Options**

### **Option 1: Upgrade Render Plan ($7/month)** ⭐ RECOMMENDED
**Why:** Enables UDP ports needed for MediaSoup WebRTC
- Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
- Select: `video-call-backend` service
- Click: "Upgrade" → Choose "Starter" plan ($7/month)
- **Benefit:** Full WebRTC support, better performance

---

### **Option 2: Use FREE TURN Server** (FREE but complex)
Add this to **Render Environment Variables**:

```bash
# Add these to Render Dashboard → video-call-backend → Environment
WEBRTC_USE_TURN=true
TURN_SERVER_URL=turn:openrelay.metered.ca:80
TURN_USERNAME=openrelayproject
TURN_PASSWORD=openrelayproject
```

**Steps:**
1. Go to Render Dashboard
2. Click `video-call-backend` → Environment
3. Add each variable above
4. Click "Save Changes"
5. Wait for restart

**Limitation:** Slower performance, shared free server

---

### **Option 3: Deploy to Local/VPS** (FREE but requires setup)
**Best for development/testing:**

```bash
# On your local machine (Windows)
cd c:\Users\hp\Desktop\vcfinal\video-call-module-\backend
npm start

# On another terminal
cd c:\Users\hp\Desktop\vcfinal\video-call-module-\frontend
npm start
```

**Access:** http://localhost:3000

**To make it public (using ngrok):**
```bash
# Install ngrok: https://ngrok.com/download
ngrok http 5000
# Copy the https URL and update frontend .env
```

## 🔧 **Why This Happens**

| Component | Render Free | Render Paid | Local |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| HTTP/HTTPS | ✅ Works | ✅ Works | ✅ Works |
| WebSocket | ✅ Works | ✅ Works | ✅ Works |
| **UDP Ports** | ❌ **BLOCKED** | ✅ Works | ✅ Works |
| MediaSoup | ❌ Fails | ✅ Works | ✅ Works |

**MediaSoup needs UDP** for real-time video streaming. Render free tier only allows TCP.

## 📊 **Quick Diagnosis**

Your current status:
```
✅ Backend deployed
✅ Frontend deployed  
✅ Database connected
✅ Socket.IO working
✅ Authentication working
❌ WebRTC transport FAILING (UDP blocked)
```

## 💡 **My Recommendation**

**For Production:** Upgrade to Render Starter ($7/month)
- Simplest solution
- Better performance
- Professional deployment

**For Testing:** Run locally
- Completely FREE
- Full control
- Perfect for development

---

## 🆘 **Still Having Issues?**

Check these:
1. **Is MEDIASOUP_ANNOUNCED_IP set?**
   - Go to Render → video-call-backend → Environment
   - Should be: `video-call-backend-nb87.onrender.com`

2. **Are all environment variables added?**
   - Check `.env.render` file
   - Must add ALL variables manually to Render Dashboard

3. **Try restarting backend:**
   - Render Dashboard → Manual Deploy → "Deploy latest commit"
