# üîê HTTPS SETUP COMPLETE!

## ‚úÖ What's Been Configured:

### SSL Certificates Generated:
- **Frontend**: `frontend/ssl/cert.pem` and `frontend/ssl/key.pem`
- **Backend**: `backend/ssl/cert.pem` and `backend/ssl/key.pem`
- **Type**: Self-signed (valid for 365 days)
- **Hosts**: localhost, 127.0.0.1, 10.164.114.166

### Servers Configured for HTTPS:
- **Backend**: Will run on `https://localhost:5000` and `https://10.164.114.166:5000`
- **Frontend**: Will run on `https://localhost:3000` and `https://10.164.114.166:3000`

## üöÄ How to Start:

### Step 1: Start Backend (HTTPS)
```powershell
cd C:\Users\hp\Desktop\vcfinal\video-call-module-\backend
npm start
```

**Expected output:**
```
üîê HTTPS server created with SSL certificates
üöÄ Video Call Server running on port 5000
   Protocol: HTTPS
   Local: https://localhost:5000
   Network: https://10.164.114.166:5000
```

### Step 2: Start Frontend (HTTPS)
```powershell
cd C:\Users\hp\Desktop\vcfinal\video-call-module-\frontend
npm start
```

**Expected output:**
```
Compiled successfully!

You can now view the app in the browser.
  Local:            https://localhost:3000
  On Your Network:  https://10.164.114.166:3000
```

## üåê Access URLs:

### From Main Computer:
- Frontend: `https://localhost:3000`
- Backend API: `https://localhost:5000`

### From Other Devices (Phone/Tablet):
- Frontend: `https://10.164.114.166:3000`
- Backend API: `https://10.164.114.166:5000`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Browser Security Warning

**You WILL see a security warning** because the certificates are self-signed. This is normal and safe for development.

### How to Accept the Certificate:

#### Chrome:
1. You'll see "Your connection is not private"
2. Click **"Advanced"**
3. Click **"Proceed to localhost (unsafe)"** or **"Proceed to 10.164.114.166 (unsafe)"**
4. Done! ‚úÖ

#### Firefox:
1. You'll see "Warning: Potential Security Risk Ahead"
2. Click **"Advanced..."**
3. Click **"Accept the Risk and Continue"**
4. Done! ‚úÖ

#### Edge:
1. You'll see "Your connection isn't private"
2. Click **"Advanced"**
3. Click **"Continue to localhost (unsafe)"**
4. Done! ‚úÖ

## üì± Testing with Multiple Devices:

### Step 1: Accept Certificate on Main Computer
1. Open `https://localhost:3000`
2. Accept the security warning (see above)
3. Login as Demo Teacher

### Step 2: Accept Certificate on Second Device (Phone/Tablet)
1. Make sure phone/tablet is on **same Wi-Fi network**
2. Open browser on phone
3. Go to `https://10.164.114.166:3000`
4. Accept the security warning
5. Login as Demo Student

### Step 3: Test Video Call
1. Teacher: Create and start a class
2. Student: Join the class using the class code
3. **Both should now see camera access working!** üé•‚ú®

## üéØ Why HTTPS Fixes Camera Access:

**Browser Security Policy:**
- ‚ùå `http://10.164.114.166` ‚Üí Camera BLOCKED (not secure)
- ‚úÖ `https://10.164.114.166` ‚Üí Camera ALLOWED (secure)
- ‚úÖ `http://localhost` ‚Üí Camera ALLOWED (special exception)
- ‚úÖ `https://localhost` ‚Üí Camera ALLOWED (secure)

**With HTTPS, both devices can:**
- ‚úÖ Access camera
- ‚úÖ Access microphone
- ‚úÖ Share screen
- ‚úÖ Join video calls
- ‚úÖ See other participants

## üîß Troubleshooting:

### Issue: "Cannot connect to server"
**Solution:** Make sure backend is running and you accepted the certificate:
1. Go to `https://10.164.114.166:5000` directly in browser
2. Accept the certificate
3. You should see: `Cannot GET /` (this is normal - it means server is running)
4. Now try the frontend again

### Issue: "Mixed Content" error
**Solution:** Make sure both frontend and backend URLs use `https://`:
- Check `.env.local`: Should have `https://localhost:5000`
- Check `.env`: Should have `https://10.164.114.166:5000`

### Issue: "ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID"
**Solution:** This is the security warning. Click "Advanced" and "Proceed anyway"

### Issue: Frontend won't start with HTTPS
**Solution:** 
1. Make sure `ssl/cert.pem` and `ssl/key.pem` exist in frontend folder
2. Check `.env.local` has:
   ```
   HTTPS=true
   SSL_CRT_FILE=ssl/cert.pem
   SSL_KEY_FILE=ssl/key.pem
   ```

### Issue: Backend starts with HTTP instead of HTTPS
**Solution:**
1. Check if `ssl/cert.pem` and `ssl/key.pem` exist in backend folder
2. If missing, run: `node generate-ssl.js` in backend folder
