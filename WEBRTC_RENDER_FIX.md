# 🔧 WebRTC Connection Fix for Render Deployment

## ❌ Problem: Send Transport Failed

Your logs show:
```
❌ SEND TRANSPORT FAILED - Streaming will not work
📡 [SendTransport] connectionstatechange -> failed
```

This happens because **MediaSoup WebRTC needs the correct public IP** to establish peer connections.

---

## ✅ SOLUTION: Add Missing Environment Variables

### **Step 1: Add to Render Backend Dashboard**

Go to: https://dashboard.render.com → `video-call-backend` → **Environment** tab

**Add these 3 CRITICAL variables:**

| Key | Value | Why It's Critical |
|-----|-------|-------------------|
| `MEDIASOUP_ANNOUNCED_IP` | `video-call-backend-nb87.onrender.com` | **MOST CRITICAL** - Tells WebRTC clients where to connect |
| `MEDIASOUP_MIN_PORT` | `10000` | Port range for RTC connections |
| `MEDIASOUP_MAX_PORT` | `10100` | Port range for RTC connections |

### **Step 2: Update Existing Variable**

| Key | Old Value | New Value | Why |
|-----|-----------|-----------|-----|
| `MEDIASOUP_WORKER_COUNT` | `8` | `2` | Render free tier has limited resources |

---

## 📋 Complete Environment Variables Checklist

After adding the above, your Render backend should have **ALL** of these:

```bash
✅ NODE_ENV=production
✅ PORT=5000
✅ DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_Md8Lk6fromCY@ep-old-shadow-adhkxq37-pooler.c-2.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
✅ JWT_SECRET=video-call-super-secret-jwt-key-change-in-production-12345
✅ JWT_EXPIRE=7d
✅ USE_REDIS=false
✅ CORS_ORIGIN=https://video-call-frontend-jwku.onrender.com

🆕 MEDIASOUP_ANNOUNCED_IP=video-call-backend-nb87.onrender.com  ← ADD THIS!
🆕 MEDIASOUP_MIN_PORT=10000                                     ← ADD THIS!
🆕 MEDIASOUP_MAX_PORT=10100                                     ← ADD THIS!
🔧 MEDIASOUP_WORKER_COUNT=2                                     ← CHANGE FROM 8!

✅ TRUST_PROXY=1
✅ RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000
✅ RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=1000
```

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Why This Was Failing

### **The Problem:**
```javascript
// MediasoupService.js line 100
announcedIp: process.env.MEDIASOUP_ANNOUNCED_IP || '127.0.0.1'
```

Without `MEDIASOUP_ANNOUNCED_IP`, it defaults to `127.0.0.1` (localhost).

When the frontend tries to connect:
1. ✅ Socket.IO connects successfully (via HTTPS)
2. ✅ WebRTC transports are created on backend
3. ❌ Frontend tries to connect to `127.0.0.1:10000` (which doesn't exist!)
4. ❌ Connection fails → "Send transport failed"

### **The Fix:**
Set `MEDIASOUP_ANNOUNCED_IP=video-call-backend-nb87.onrender.com`

Now the frontend connects to the correct public address!

---

## 🔍 How to Verify It's Working

### **After adding the variables:**

1. **Wait 30-60 seconds** for backend to restart
2. **Check Render logs** for:
   ```
   ✅ Mediasoup SFU Service initialized
   ```
3. **Test in browser** (teacher login):
   - Should see: `✅ Send transport connected`
   - Should see: `✅ Producer created`
   - Should see local video

4. **Check browser console** - Should show:
   ```
   ✅ Send transport connected
   📤 Producing video track...
   ✅ video PRODUCER CREATED
   ```

### **Success Indicators:**
✅ No more "Send transport failed" errors
✅ Local video appears in teacher view
✅ Students can see teacher's video
✅ Chat messages work

## 🎯 Quick Action Plan

**Do this RIGHT NOW:**

1. **Go to Render Dashboard**: https://dashboard.render.com
2. **Click**: `video-call-backend` service
3. **Click**: "Environment" tab (left sidebar)
4. **Add 3 variables**:
   - `MEDIASOUP_ANNOUNCED_IP` = `video-call-backend-nb87.onrender.com`
   - `MEDIASOUP_MIN_PORT` = `10000`
   - `MEDIASOUP_MAX_PORT` = `10100`
5. **Update 1 variable**:
   - Change `MEDIASOUP_WORKER_COUNT` from `8` to `2`
6. **Click "Save Changes"** (bottom of page)
7. **Wait 60 seconds** for restart
8. **Test again** - video should work! 🎉

## ⚠️ Render Free Tier Limitations

### **Known Issues:**

1. **Port Restrictions**: Render free tier may block UDP ports (10000-10100)
   - **Solution**: Use TCP fallback (already configured in MediaSoup)

2. **Resource Limits**: Free tier has 512MB RAM
   - **Why we reduced workers from 8 → 2**

3. **Cold Starts**: Service sleeps after 15 minutes of inactivity
   - First connection may take 30-60 seconds

### **If Video Still Doesn't Work:**

You may need to **upgrade to Render Paid Plan** ($7/month) for:
- ✅ UDP port access
- ✅ Better performance
- ✅ No cold starts

---

## 📞 Alternative: Use Public TURN Servers

If Render's ports are blocked, add TURN server fallback:

**Add to backend `.env`:**
```bash
TURN_SERVER_URL=turn:openrelay.metered.ca:80
TURN_USERNAME=openrelayproject
TURN_PASSWORD=openrelayproject
```

This routes WebRTC through a public relay server (slower but works everywhere).

## 🎓 Understanding the Architecture

```
[Student Browser]
      ↓
   HTTPS (works) → Socket.IO connects
      ↓
   WebRTC Setup → Backend sends "connect to X:Y"
      ↓
   WITHOUT FIX: "connect to 127.0.0.1:10000" ❌ FAILS
   WITH FIX:    "connect to video-call-backend-nb87.onrender.com:10000" ✅ WORKS
      ↓
   [MediaSoup RTC Connection]
      ↓
   Video/Audio Streaming 🎥
```

## 📝 Summary

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Send transport failed | Missing `MEDIASOUP_ANNOUNCED_IP` | Add backend domain to env vars |
| WebRTC not connecting | Using localhost (127.0.0.1) | Set announced IP to Render domain |
| No video streaming | Clients can't reach RTC ports | Configure correct public address |

**Bottom Line**: Add `MEDIASOUP_ANNOUNCED_IP=video-call-backend-nb87.onrender.com` to Render environment variables!

---

## ✅ Expected Result After Fix

**Teacher logs should show:**
```
✅ Send transport connected
✅ Producer created: [video-id]
✅ Producer created: [audio-id]
✅ WebRTC initialization completed
```

**Student logs should show:**
```
✅ Receive transport connected
✅ Consumer created for teacher video
✅ Remote stream received
```

**You should see:**
- 🎥 Teacher's video in their own view
- 🎥 Teacher's video in student's view
- 🎤 Audio working both ways
- 💬 Chat working

---

## 🆘 Still Not Working?

Check these:

1. **Render backend logs** - Look for MediaSoup errors
2. **Browser console** - Check for WebRTC errors
3. **Network tab** - Verify WebSocket connections
4. **Try different browser** - Chrome works best
5. **Check firewall** - Corporate networks may block WebRTC

If still failing → Render free tier likely blocking UDP ports → Upgrade to paid plan.
